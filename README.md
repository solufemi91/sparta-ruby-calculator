## The brief

**Calculator**

*Timings*
90 minutes

**Tasks**
Your task is to write a command line calculator application that has two settings, (b)asic and (a)dvanced.
- First you will need to ask the user for which calculator they want to use
- Then you will need to ask the user for the numbers to operate on.
- Then you need to work out what to do with the numbers, depending on what operation they choose.

**Basic:**
  - Additon
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Subtraction

**Advanced:**
  - Power
  - Square root

**Setup**
There is no starter code for this app.

**Hints**
You will need to find how to get the user input with Ruby

**Bonus task** - Add some additional functionality
Add the following calculator feature into your app.

**BMI Calculator**
Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight - the user should be able to choose between the imperial and the metric system

**SUPER Bonus task**
Add the following calculator feature into your app.
*Trip Calculator*
This feature asks the user for four inputs; distance, fuel efficiency (mpg), cost per gallon, speed and it will give you the time and price of your journey.
**Example output:** "Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost £255.33.""
**Note:** For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative - how will you handle this?)

Wikipedia
Body mass index
The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
The BMI may also be determined using a table or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement Show more… (181 kB)
